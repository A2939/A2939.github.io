The Fourth Degree is the patriotic degree of the order. On February 22, 1900, the first exemplification of the Fourth Degree was held in New York City. To the three principles of our Order: Charity, Unity and Fraternity, the final lesson that was added is the virtue of patriotism. The focus of the Fourth Degree is on this principle, an abiding love for and devotion to one's country. The primary purpose of the Fourth Degree is to foster the spirit of patriotism by promoting responsible citizenship and a love of and loyalty to the Knights' respective countries through membership in local Fourth Degree groups called Assemblies.

## Wreaths Across America <img src="assets/img/waa.png">
The Fourth Degree of the Knights of Columbus is the PATRIOTIC degree of the Order. There is nothing more patriotic than honoring the graves of our fallen local Veteran Heroes. For the past three years we have made this a major project both financially and as a service project. 
## Chalice Program <img src="assets/img/chalise2.jpg" width="250">
The Chalice program is available to any member of the assembly. Members who join the program agree to purchase a chalice to be given to a priest after the passing of the member. The members name is engraved on the base of the chalice as a memorial to that member. Please contact the worthy Comptroller to take part in this program.
