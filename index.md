<b>The Fourth Degree</b> is the patriotic degree of the order. On February 22, 1900, the first
exemplification of the Fourth Degree was held in New York City. To the three principles
of our Order: Charity, Unity and Fraternity, the final lesson that was added is the virtue
of patriotism. The focus of the Fourth Degree is on this principle, an abiding love for
and devotion to one's country. The primary purpose of the Fourth Degree is to foster the
spirit of patriotism by promoting responsible citizenship and a love of and loyalty to
the Knights' respective countries through membership in local Fourth Degree groups called
  Assemblies.</p>
