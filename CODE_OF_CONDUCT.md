# Citizen Code of Conduct

Social communications should be used in a manner consistent with
Catholic values and principles of the Order. Members who use social
communications should carefully review and at all times observe the
Order’s Social Communications Guidelines and Policy, which can
befound under the Social Communications tab on the Officer’s Desk
Reference located in Officer’s Online at www.kofc.org. The Guidelines
and Policy apply to members and subordinate units of the Order when
they choose to identify themselves as members of the Knights of
Columbus or to discuss the work of the Knights of Columbus using
social communications. Members should be aware that the Laws and
official policies of the Knights of Columbus apply to fraternal social
communications as they would in any other setting. The reputation
of the Order depends upon how members conduct themselves,
both online and in person. Accordingly, members using social
communications should remember that they are expected to
conduct themselves as Catholic gentlemen, which at a minimum
requires that any material posted online respects human dignity
and maintains a culture of respectful dialogue and friendship.(Protocol Handbook, 2020)
