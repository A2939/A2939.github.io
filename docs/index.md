The Fourth Degree of the Knights of Columbus is the PATRIOTIC degree of the Order. 
There is nothing more patriotic than honoring the graves of our fallen local
Veteran Heroes. For the past three years we have made this a major project both 
financially and as a service project. </td>

      <h2><em>The Chalice Program</em></h2> is available to any member of the assembly. Members who join the
program agree to purchase a chalice to be given to a priest after the passing of the
member. The members name is engraved on the base of the chalice as a memorial to that
member. Please contact the worthy Comptroller to take part in this program.

    During the convention, the Good of the Order Committee stated: “We commend all of the
faithful Sir Knights who have proudly worn the Fourth Degree regalia, bringing much
respect to the Order. With the new Fourth Degree uniform, recently approved by the Board
of Directors, this honor and respect associated with Sir Knights will remain, and it will
open the door more widely for a new generation to join their ranks. In a spirit of unity,
let us assist with a smooth transition to this new uniform and encourage it to be worn
with great dignity and pride.”
